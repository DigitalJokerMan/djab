dj's amazing bundle format (v2.0)

The first version required two seperate files and it was pretty simple, this version should be much more advanced and flexible.

magic number -- 1 byte (17 -- might change in the future)
version identifier -- unsigned byte (currently 2)

compression type -- unsigned byte (reserved; not used yet)

number of entries in index -- unsigned long
// data section beginning -- unsigned long

INDEX ENTRY:
    key -- string
    offset (from the beginning of the data section) -- unsigned long
    size -- unsigned long

DATA SECTION:
    self-explanatory
